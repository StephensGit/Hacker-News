## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to re-design Hacker News utilising the Hacker News API to create a web application that shows the latest stories. This project doesn't implement a user profile page or comments, it's just a redesign the front page of hacker news.

This project is still ongoing, and the main reason I began this was to practice using Jest which is a JavaScript testing framework. The project will use Webpack and Babel.
